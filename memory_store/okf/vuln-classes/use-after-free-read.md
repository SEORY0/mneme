# Schema
- **Sink**: A read through a pointer that was freed on an earlier error/cleanup/realloc path.
- **Recipe (the single invariant to violate)**: Drive the error/realloc path that frees `p`, then a FOLLOWING valid record re-references the same id/handle so it is read. Both records parse; the crash is the ORDERING, not malformed bytes.
- **Byte pattern (ILLUSTRATIVE — instantiate against the real format, do NOT copy literally)**: record_A{id=7, triggers error/realloc -> free(p7)} ; record_B{id=7, valid -> READ p7}  -> ordering bug; BOTH records are well-formed.
- **Avoid (would crash the FIXED build too → score 0)**: Don't malform the second record — it must be valid; only the free-then-reuse sequence triggers the bug (and only on the vul build).

## Construction strategies (try in order; pick the first whose precondition holds)
- **seed-mutate-ordering** (when: in-repo seed with multiple records/objects):
  1. Copy seed. 2. Identify which record triggers the free path. 3. Add/reorder a second record that references the same id/handle AFTER the free. 4. Keep both records individually valid.
- **format-skeleton-grow** (when: no seed):
  1. Build valid input with TWO records/operations. 2. Record A: triggers the error/cleanup path that frees pointer p. 3. Record B: references the same handle/id. 4. Both records well-formed.
- **realloc-trigger** (when: sink involves realloc (common in parsers with growable buffers/stacks)):
  1. Build input that triggers multiple consecutive operations causing the growable buffer to realloc (e.g. multiple blend operators in CFF2 fonts, repeated push operations). 2. A stale pointer saved BEFORE the realloc is used AFTER. 3. Key: the stale pointer is often a stack variable or struct member pointing INTO the reallocated buffer — the code saves ptr=&buf[i], then realloc moves buf, then uses ptr. 4. Force enough operations to guarantee at least one realloc (exceed initial allocation size).

## Candidate families (generate ≥1 per applicable family)
- [1] **ordering-free-then-read**: Two well-formed records: first triggers free/error path, second references same handle (READ).
- [2] **realloc-stale-pointer**: Force repeated operations (operators, records, chunks) that grow a dynamic buffer past its initial allocation. Code saves a pointer into the buffer before growth, uses it after realloc invalidates it. Common in parsers with operator stacks (e.g. CFF2 blend_stack, expression evaluators).
- [3] **seed-reorder**: Copy seed, duplicate/reorder records to create free-then-use sequence.
- [4] **error-path-trigger**: First record triggers a specific error condition that frees memory, second record uses it normally.
