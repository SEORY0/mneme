# Schema
- **Sink**: memcpy/strcpy/buf[i]=... WRITE into a heap allocation sized from one field while the copy length comes from another.
- **Recipe (the single invariant to violate)**: Source/copy length = capacity+1 (one byte past the allocation). Keep the allocation-sizing field at its honest small value.
- **Byte pattern (ILLUSTRATIVE — instantiate against the real format, do NOT copy literally)**: hdr + [alloc_len=N] + [copy_len=N+1] + <N+1 bytes>  -> dst heap-sized N, copy writes one past. alloc_len stays N (do NOT enlarge it).
- **Avoid (would crash the FIXED build too → score 0)**: Don't enlarge the allocation field too — only the length must exceed capacity by one.

## Construction strategies (try in order; pick the first whose precondition holds)
- **seed-mutate** (when: in-repo seed exists):
  1. Copy seed as bytearray. 2. Find the field controlling copy/write length at the sink. 3. Set copy_len = alloc_len + 1. 4. Ensure the source data has copy_len bytes available. 5. Keep alloc_len unchanged.
- **format-skeleton-grow** (when: whole-file harness, no seed):
  1. Build valid file: magic + header + records. 2. Set copy_len = alloc_len + 1 in the record reaching the sink. 3. Provide copy_len bytes of source data.
- **fdp-carve** (when: FuzzedDataProvider harness):
  1. Map FDP consumption. 2. Set the length field that controls the copy = alloc+1. 3. Fill remaining with valid defaults.
- **libfuzzer-minimal** (when: thin wrapper):
  1. Build bytes >= min_size. 2. Set copy length field = allocation + 1.

## Candidate families (generate ≥1 per applicable family)
- [1] **seed-mutate-length**: Copy seed, increase copy/write length field by 1 past allocation size.
- [2] **skeleton-length-mismatch**: Build minimal valid file, alloc_size=N, copy_len=N+1, provide N+1 source bytes.
- [3] **boundary-probe**: Try copy_len = alloc+1, alloc+2, alloc (should not crash) to isolate the trigger.

- Support: 7 train-set solves.
- Winning strategies (observed): {'seed-sweep': 4, 'hint-literal': 1, 'fuzzer': 1, 'construct': 1}
- Format families (observed): {'media-container': 1, 'pcap': 1, 'pdf': 1}
- Abstract sink shapes (observed): heap-buffer-overflow:WRITE
