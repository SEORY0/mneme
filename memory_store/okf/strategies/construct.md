## What
Build a structurally-valid input declaratively (`construct` for binary containers, or raw
`struct.pack`/templates for flat/text formats), then violate exactly one field.

## When
No usable seed, and the format is a nested/chunked/box container (PNG/MNG, PDF content streams, …)
where hand-counting offsets is error-prone.

## Steps
1. Declare the skeleton with `construct` (use `Rebuild(Int32xb, len_(this.data))` so lengths auto-compute).
2. `build()` a baseline with every field valid (magic, header, ≥1 record/box/chunk).
3. Change the ONE field that violates the just-added check (short length, oversized index, deep nesting).
4. CRC/checksum fields are usually unchecked → set to 0.
5. Validate locally; iterate with `coverage_check` if the sink is not reached.

## Pitfalls
- Keep the prefix valid — decoders bail on bad magic/first record before reaching the sink.
- Only the violation field should be "wrong"; an over-corrupt input crashes the fix too (score 0).

## Observed
- Support: 11 train-set solves.
- Winning strategies (observed): {'construct': 11}
- Format families (observed): {'chunked-image': 1, 'json': 1, 'cff2-font': 1, 'yara-rules': 1, 'sip-text': 1, 'text-expr': 1, 'media-container': 3, 'md3-model': 1, 'pdf': 1}
- Abstract sink shapes (observed): heap-buffer-overflow:READ, heap-buffer-overflow:WRITE, heap-use-after-free:READ, stack-overflow:?, undefined-behavior:?, use-after-poison:READ, use-of-uninitialized-value:?
