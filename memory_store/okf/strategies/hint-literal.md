## What
When description.txt states an explicit input (a directive, magic string, or boundary integer), feed
it verbatim (text targets) or embed it at the right offset (binary).

## When
Text/source targets — assemblers, interpreters, config/markup parsers — whose bug is described
literally (e.g. an assembler `.file <huge-int> "x.c"` directive).

## Steps
1. Extract the quoted/backticked snippet or the boundary number from the description.
2. For a text harness, write it as the whole input (add a trailing newline if line-oriented).
3. For a binary harness, place the literal/boundary value at the field the description names.

## Pitfalls
- A truncated/unbalanced literal may be rejected before the sink — keep it syntactically complete.

## Observed
- Support: 2 train-set solves.
- Winning strategies (observed): {'hint-literal': 2}
- Format families (observed): {'text-expr': 1}
- Abstract sink shapes (observed): double-free:?, heap-buffer-overflow:WRITE
