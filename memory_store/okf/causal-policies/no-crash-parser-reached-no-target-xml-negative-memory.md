# No Crash Parser Reached No Target Xml Negative Memory

- key: `no_crash x parser_reached_no_target`
- outcome: persistent failure / basin to avoid
- success_count: 0
- failure_count: 1
- related format facts: [[xml]]
- related harness facts: [[libfuzzer]]

## Failure Shape
- Plain XML names, repeated attributes/elements, a fixed-seed dictionary hash collision pair, and a sweep that tried to place a shorter colliding name near the dictionary string-pool boundary all parsed without an ASAN read.
- The remaining missing piece is likely a parser call that performs a length-based dictionary lookup against an existing shorter interned name while that name is positioned at an allocation boundary.

## Policy
Treat `no_crash x parser_reached_no_target` on `xml` as a basin to avoid unless a new candidate changes the parser gate, state relation, or target-sink relation described above. Preserve any proven reachability, but discard variants that return to the same clean-exit, off-target-crash, wrong-sink, usage-only, or both-image-crash basin.

## Procedure
1. Keep only the smallest parser or harness envelope that the verifier proved was reached.
2. Identify the missing causal relation from the signal: parser selection, container acceptance, length relation, stateful subobject, allocation state, or official target sink.
3. Change one relation at a time and discard candidates that return to this same basin.
4. If a local crash is not an official target match, shrink or discard it before mutating deeper fields.
5. Promote a recovery from this basin only after a later verifier-confirmed target match.

## Negative Memory
- Do not resubmit broad mutations that only reproduce `parser_reached_no_target`.
- Do not count parser reachability, local wrapper crashes, both-image crashes, or clean exits as success.
- Do not store raw payload bytes, exact positions, task identifiers, checksums, or submit metadata.

## Format Contract
Use [[xml]] for descriptive format gates and invariants.

## Harness Contract
Use [[libfuzzer]] for the input-carving contract.

## Evidence Shape
- Support: 1 diagnosed persistent failure from round 17.
- Scope: generator repair and basin avoidance only.
