# Libfuzzer Harness

## Round 6 Input Contract
- The libFuzzer harness treats the input prefix as the binary message and consumes a fixed-width suffix from the back as a memory limit. The crash depends on satisfying the binary message parser and then forcing allocation failure through that suffix.
- The libFuzzer harness consumes raw bytes, clamps very large inputs, selects a platform from the first byte modulo the platform table, enables Capstone detail mode, disassembles the remaining bytes, then prints instruction names, implicit registers, and groups to a sink file. No file envelope or checksum is used.
- The harness is libFuzzer over raw bytes copied to a fixed input path. It opens the MIMIC decoder directly, accepts only the supported frame dimensions, and may derive codec context fields from a trailing configuration area only when the input is large enough.
- The harness passes the raw input bytes directly to the PostGIS WKB importer with parser checks disabled. There is no mode selector or FuzzedDataProvider carving; reachability is controlled entirely by a syntactically plausible WKB record tree.
- The libFuzzer harness rejects very short and oversized inputs, treats the leading region as the disassembly buffer, reads the final selector fields from the end of the input, looks up a BFD architecture, then calls the selected disassembler repeatedly with an in-memory disassemble_info buffer.
- The harness creates sockets, iterates through the socket option range, calls setsockopt with the entire fuzzer byte buffer and its explicit size, and then tries getsockopt. It does not carve selector fields from the input; reachability depends on the loop hitting the vulnerable option with a buffer length in the sensitive range.
- The harness is libFuzzer over a single raw file path. The wrapper runs the selected fuzzer directly against the copied input and reports clean execution for short arbitrary bytes.
- The generated run directory invoked the generic local arvo wrapper, but verifier output identified the active binary as a qpdf fuzzer rather than a JPEG decoder harness. Official target matching rejected the local off-target crash.
- The libFuzzer harness treats the input as raw CIL source, adds it as a policy file, compiles it, builds and optimizes a policydb, and writes the result to a null output. Triggering this bug requires reaching compile-time resolution and verification, not policydb serialization alone.
- The secilc libFuzzer target consumes the raw file as policy text, reports syntax errors for malformed text, and ships a seed corpus from the upstream policy test directory.
- The libFuzzer harness passes the raw bytes to c-blosc2 frame reconstruction, checks the declared uncompressed size, allocates an output buffer, attempts chunk decompression, and then frees the reconstructed container. There is no front selector; valid frame reconstruction is the main gate.
- The wrapper invokes the dav1d multithreaded fuzzer on the copied raw input. Local signal can disagree with the official server for wrapper-level crashes, so official vul/fix comparison is required.
- The harness feeds raw bytes to the Ghostscript raster path through the arvo wrapper. It does not expose a separate mode selector; the payload must be a self-contained PostScript/PDF resource that makes Ghostscript load and execute the CMap parser.
- The raster harness pipes the raw input as a Ghostscript job on stdin using a CUPS raster device. There is no fuzzer-carved selector; the input must be a complete enough PostScript/PDF job to reach font stream decoding.
- The libFuzzer harness passes the raw file bytes to RawSpeed's DcrDecoder-specific TIFF decoder fuzzer. There is no FuzzedDataProvider layout; malformed headers may crash earlier than the target decoder method.
- The harness feeds raw bytes to Ghostscript configured with the pdfwrite device. The input must be a valid enough document or PostScript program for pdfwrite conversion, and the vulnerable sink is behind font embedding/subsetting rather than basic page rendering.
- The MuPDF pdf_fuzzer consumes the raw file as a PDF and attempts parsing/repair through the normal document machinery. Non-PDF bytes fail at version/object recognition before the target path.
- The DuckDB parse/query fuzzer runs the raw input as SQL with verification enabled and reports only crashes or selected internal-result mismatches. There is no binary framing or mode selector; the payload must be executable SQL that reaches aggregate execution.
- The harness consumes raw PDF bytes, opens the document from memory, iterates pages, and renders them. There is no explicit selector; page/resource traversal is needed to force indirect object loading after xref repair.
- The fuzz_process_packet libFuzzer target passes the raw file bytes directly to nDPI packet detection as one L3 packet. IPv4 total length and TCP header length must match the HTTP payload for the parser to reach the HTTP dissector.
- The libFuzzer harness treats input as a raw PDF document, opens it from memory, iterates pages, adds or reads annotations, and renders pages. There is no selector byte; the PDF catalog, page tree, page object, and annotation object must all be coherent enough for Poppler to reach annotation processing.
- The wrapper invokes the Capstone disassembly fuzzer directly on the copied raw input. It accepts arbitrary byte strings, but only specific encodings exercise detailed ARM memory operand handling.
