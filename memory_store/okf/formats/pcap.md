# Schema
## Structure
Not yet curated in detail. Identify the magic/header, keep the prefix valid to reach the sink, and prefer seed-mutate when a corpus exists.

# Examples
- Support: 4 train-set solves.
- Winning strategies (observed): {'seed-sweep': 3, 'fuzzer': 1}
- Format families (observed): {'pcap': 4}
- Abstract sink shapes (observed): heap-buffer-overflow:READ, heap-buffer-overflow:WRITE

# Citations
- Distilled from train-set solves with this format + curated format knowledge.
