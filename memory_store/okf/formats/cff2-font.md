# Schema
## Identification
OpenType font with a CFF2 outline table (`OTTO` sfnt) — a VARIABLE font, so it also needs `fvar`
(variation axes) and the CFF2 must carry a VariationStore. FreeType/HarfBuzz parse it; the fuzzer
selects named instances / variation coords, exercising the variable path.

## Structure
- sfnt: `OTTO` + table directory (head, hhea, hmtx, maxp(0.5), cmap, name, OS/2, post, **CFF2**, **fvar**).
- CFF2 table: header `[2,0,5,topDictLen(2)]` → TopDICT (CharStrings op17 / vstore op24 / FDArray op12 36)
  → CharStrings INDEX (CFF2 INDEX = count uint32, offSize, offsets, data) → VariationStore → FDArray
  (INDEX of FontDicts, each `Private(size offset op18)`) → Private DICT.
- Private DICT operators: numbers (CFF encoding), `vsindex`(22), `blend`(23). `blend` consumes
  `<master vals> <region deltas> <numBlends>` and leaves blended results ON the operand stack for the
  following operator to consume.

## Where bugs hide (observed)
- CFF2 `blend` handling. (Real pattern: each `blend` appends to a `blend_stack` that is grown with
  realloc; CONSECUTIVE blend operators whose results are not yet consumed leave operand-stack entries
  pointing INTO the old blend_stack — a later blend's realloc MOVES/frees that buffer, and the parser
  re-reads the stale pointers → heap-use-after-free READ in the DICT number parser.)

## How to build (hand-assemble the CFF2; wrap with fontTools)
1. Encode a CFF2 with a Private DICT = `vsindex 0` then several CHAINED `blend` ops (push master+delta,
   `1 blend`, repeat) ending in a value operator (e.g. BlueValues op6) — enough blends to force the
   blend_stack realloc.
2. Minimal VariationStore (1 axis, 1 region) so `vsindex`/`blend` are valid; 1 trivial CharString.
3. Build a CFF1 OTF skeleton with `fontBuilder` (head/maxp/cmap/...), then MANUALLY repack the sfnt
   swapping `CFF ` → raw `CFF2` bytes and adding a 1-axis `fvar` (fontTools won't emit malformed DICTs,
   so the CFF2 must be raw). Recompute head.checkSumAdjustment.

## Reachability
The font must open as a variable CFF2 face (valid sfnt + fvar + CFF2 vstore); the Private DICT is parsed
during face init, so the bug fires at load time — no glyph rendering needed.
